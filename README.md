# Youtube2mp3

This is a simple youtube convert and download script to download music from youtube.
I used to use online sites to convert videos into mp3 formats and I felt that I could find a way to do it myself.
Here is that outcome. 

# Usage:

1: give executable rights to python script
`$ sudo chmod 755 Youtube2mp3.py`

2: run script
`$ ./Youtube2mp3.py --video <insert video link here>`

# That's it!
There's really nothing much to it. Enjoy!
